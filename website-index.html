<p id="schoolclubs"> During my time at Central, I have been in two leadership positions as the Treasurer of The T.E.E.C.A (Technology and Engineering Collegiate Association) Club Treasurer and Central Cares President.</p>

<p class="second"> I was also a Resident Assistant (RA) for two years; I was placed in Mid Campus Residence Hall and Beecher Hall which both led to great adminstirative experiences.</p>

<p class="center"> This past summer, my best friend Ethan and I founded Infinite Education. This company aims to use the energy of superheroes and gamified learning to ultimately change education for the better</p>

<p> Our custom "learning superheroes" named Professor Duality and Journeyman will surely get kids excited to learn again.</p>
<p> Imagine Professor Duality guiding you through the fundamentals of coding alongside a epic superhero story! </p>
