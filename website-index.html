<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <!-- 1st 2 lines perfect - doctype declaration & html opener, next up, you need an opener for the <head> section in which the <title> element will live, then make certain to close the </head> and open the content portion of your webpage with a <body> opener tag, before the <h1>. The <link href...> element belongs up in the <head>. Copying this code into the HTML Validator at https://validator.w3.org/ would help you to see this and debug it on your own. It's a good idea because while Chrome may be forgiving, not all browsers that reach your website will "forgive" the invalid html & thus you could have bugs in your otherwise awesome webpage! :) -->

<title> Jack Robert Clonan: The First Teaching Superhero </title>
<!-- after creating the <head> section, I moved your external stylesheet code into the <head> so your markup will valiate and it will all work well. -->

<!-- Below is the code that links my external stylesheet-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=mystyles.css>

<!-- I know that it's confusing now that the html5 spec offers us the <header> tag, but it is not the same as the <head> element, which is a crucial section in the webpage that holds the stylesheet, script, title, and any metadata information in it. The confusingly-named <header> is designed to be a section of the content part of the webpage, inserted after the <body> opens, so I fixed that up, with the </head> closing and the <body> opening immediately thereafter. The <head> element is different than the <header> element. For more on that, see: https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-the-different-between-head-and-header-again-and-what-goes-inside-each. I had to comment out the <body> that was positioned here as a result. -->
<!-- Great job with HTML commenting, btw! -->

<p class="second"> I was also a Resident Assistant (RA) for two years; I was placed in Mid Campus Residence Hall and Beecher Hall which both led to great adminstirative experiences.</p>

<p class="center"> This past summer, my best friend Ethan and I founded Infinite Education. This company aims to use the energy of superheroes and gamified learning to ultimately change education for the better</p>

<p> Our custom "learning superheroes" named Professor Duality and Journeyman will surely get kids excited to learn again.</p>
<p> Imagine Professor Duality guiding you through the fundamentals of coding alongside a epic superhero story! </p>
